The Quantity has units, possibly dimensionless units like m/m. The CSDMS semantic work has a goal of automated semantic mediation, matching or reconciliation. While the focus is on a 'lingua franca', the standard names are often built from a hierarchical set of concepts, and may eventually be used to construct a type of ontology.",
