An Assumption is not a  part of a CSDMS Standard Name; rather, it is used to describe a model or its parameters in detail. (Hence, an assumption should not be used to evaluate parameter matches in a simplistic way.) An Assumption is a broad term that can include things like conditions, simplifications, approximations, limitations, conventions, provisos and other forms of clarification. CSDMS encourages model developers to include as many &lt;assume&gt; tags in their Model Coupling Metadata (MCM) file as they feel apply to their model or its particular input or output variable; XML tag nesting determines the scope of an &lt;assume&gt; tag. The CSDMS semantic work has a goal of automated semantic mediation, matching or reconciliation. While the focus is on a 'lingua franca', the standard names are often built from a hierarchical set of concepts, and may eventually be used to construct a type of ontology.",
